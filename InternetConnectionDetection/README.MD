# Internet Connection Detection Notification with Toast | AJAX Request

JavaScript is used to send Ajax GET request to a placeholder json file URL and check that URL is sending any data as a response or not and the response status of that request URL is equal to 200 and less than 300 or not. If the passed URL is sending data as a response and the response status of that URL is also equal to 200 then the user is connected to the Internet so he/she is getting data as a response but if it isn't then the user is disconnected from the Internet.
