# Internet Connection Detection Notification with Toast | AJAX Request

JavaScript function used to send Ajax GET request to a placeholder json file URL to check that URL is sending any data as a response. Response status of that request URL is checked and if equal to 200 and less than 300 or not then deemed successful. If the passed URL is sending data as a response and the response status of that URL is also equal to 200 then the user is connected to the Internet so he/she is getting data as a response, otherwise user is deemed disconnected from the Internet.
